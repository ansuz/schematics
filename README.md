# schematics

scheme stuff, probably mostly chicken-scheme, maybe some racket.

[Because Lisp is awesome](http://xkcd.com/297/).

## Why?

Because I use Javascript for nearly everything, but I need a high-performance, expressive language. Javascript borrows heavily from Scheme's semantics, and I expect I'll be able to translate lots of my code nearly function for function.

## What will I need?

I'll be focusing on Chicken Scheme, since it compiles to binaries via C code, and seems to have a decent foreign function interface, giving me a reason to exercise my C chops which I've been neglecting.

## How can I install it?

I use Arch Linux these days, and Chicken Scheme is available via the community repositories:

`sudo pacman -S community/chicken`

If you're using something else, see [this list of platforms](http://wiki.call-cc.org/platforms) which provide it via their repositories.
